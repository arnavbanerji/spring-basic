One of the main design pattern we use when developing spring projects is - "Dependency Injection":
1) DI allows one object to connect with dependant objects. i.e. to run a laptop, we need dependant objects like hard drive, RAM, CPU etc.
2) Helps in achieving loose coupling. instance, laptop can be modified with new hard drive/RAM/CPU without affecting the whole laptop performance.
3) With loose coupling it is also possible to do testing components using Mock objects. instance in java, junit.

how to name an enterprise project:
groupId: com.arnav //package name
artifactId: demo //project name
package: com.arnav.demo.web

when downloading <dependency>hibernate</dependency>, it downloads for the first time from remote repository (repository of hibernate) then stores in a local repository. So for first time, internet is required. Local repository will be your users folder.
